create-react-app todo-app
------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is one of my first projects I made to learn how to utilize React with stateful components. It's a simple system that allows the creation of to-do tasks, as well as groups/categories and their organization.
